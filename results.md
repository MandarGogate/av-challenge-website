* STOI results (Table 2)

|      |       |      |     |   |  Speech  |     |    | Noise   |     |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|---------|---------|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| System | Overall | Speech | Noise | low SNR | mid SNR | high SNR | low SNR | mid SNR | high SNR |
| A      | 0.593   | 0.593  | 0.594 | 0.415   | 0.595   | 0.769    | 0.420   | 0.597   | 0.764    |
| B      | 0.619   | 0.578  | 0.660 | 0.529   | 0.585   | 0.622    | 0.479   | 0.687   | 0.813    |

Table 2. STOI scores (0-1) calculated across all conditions (Overall), per masker: Speech (competing speaker)
and Noise, and per masker and SNR (low, mid, high). A higher score means more intelligible. Scores were
calculated per sentence and averaged across sentences.
