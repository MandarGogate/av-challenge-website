* Intelligibility scores (Table 1)

|      |       |      |     |   <td colspan=3>Speech     |     <td colspan=3>Noise     |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|---------|---------|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| System | Overall | Speech | Noise | low SNR | mid SNR | high SNR | low SNR | mid SNR | high SNR |
| A      | 59.00   | 61.88  | 56.13 | 36.21   | 66.67   | 82.76    | 33.33   | 56.90   | 78.16    |
| B      | 52.30   | 54.41  | 50.19 | 42.53   | 58.62   | 62.07    | 29.31   | 51.15   | 70.11    |

Table 1. Word intelligibility scores (\%) calculated across all conditions (Overall), per masker: Speech (competing speaker) and Noise, and per masker and SNR (low, mid, high). 
A higher score means more intelligible. 
Scores were calculated as the percentage of words correctly identified, computed for each participant and averaged across participants.
Differences larger than the Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) are significant. Scores were calculated from the responses of 87 participants.


* STOI results (Table 2)

|      |       |      |     |   |  Speech  |     |    | Noise   |     |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|---------|---------|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| System | Overall | Speech | Noise | low SNR | mid SNR | high SNR | low SNR | mid SNR | high SNR |
| A      | 0.593   | 0.593  | 0.594 | 0.415   | 0.595   | 0.769    | 0.420   | 0.597   | 0.764    |
| B      | 0.619   | 0.578  | 0.660 | 0.529   | 0.585   | 0.622    | 0.479   | 0.687   | 0.813    |

Table 2. STOI scores (0-1) calculated across all conditions (Overall), per masker: Speech (competing speaker)
and Noise, and per masker and SNR (low, mid, high). A higher score means more intelligible. Scores were
calculated per sentence and averaged across sentences.
