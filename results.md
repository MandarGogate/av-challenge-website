Word intelligibility scores (\%) calculated across all conditions (Overall), per masker: Speech (competing speaker) and Noise, and per masker and SNR (low, mid, high). A higher score means more intelligible. Scores were calculated as the percentage of words correctly identified, computed for each participant and averaged across participants. Differences larger than the Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) are significant. Scores were calculated from the responses of 102 participants.
