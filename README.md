# 1st COG-MHEAR Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Challenge
## A machine learning challenge for next-generation hearing devices

### Challenge Summary
Human performance in everyday noisy situations is known to be dependent upon both aural and visual senses that are contextually combined by the brainâ€™s multi-level integration strategies. The multimodal nature of speech is well established, with listeners known to unconsciously lip read to improve the intelligibility of speech in a real noisy environment. Studies in neuroscience have shown that the visual aspect of speech has a potentially strong impact on the ability of humans to focus their auditory attention on a particular stimulus.

Over the last few decades, there have been major advances in machine learning applied to speech technology made possible by Machine Learning related Challenges including CHiME, REVERB, Blizzard, Clarity and Hurricane. However, the aforementioned challenges are based on single and multi-channel audio-only processing and have not exploited the multimodal nature of speech. The aim of this first audio visual (AV) speech enhancement challenge is to bring together the wider computer vision, hearing and speech research communities to explore novel approaches to multimodal speech-in-noise processing.
