# Baseline model

Challenge entrants are supplied with a fully functioning baseline model.

You are free to use any parts of the baseline that are useful to you, and reconfigure the system as you feel fit.

The model code is available at: [GitHub](https://github.com/cogmhear/avse_challenge/tree/main/baseline/avse3)

The pretrained model is available at: [model weights](https://huggingface.co/cogmhear/avsec3-baseline) [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17EEK6Q5hbCwf1rNwaZAytdAiC5aK32vI?usp=sharing)
