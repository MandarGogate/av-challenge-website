# Systems description

We encourage teams to report the following elements as part of their system description:

- Number of parameters in the model.
- FLOPS.
- Number of training steps.
- Latency (with hardware specifications).
- Real-time factor (RTF) if model is causal.
- Training time (e.g. time per epoch).
- Memory footprint (e.g., memory usage during training, inference, model loading).
- Hardware specifications (CPU, GPU, TPU, memory capacity) used for training and inference.
- Number and type of GPUs used.
- Training process: Data augmentation, batch size, optimization algorithm, learning rate schedule (or other hyperparameter tuning details), number of training epochs, early stopping criteria (if any).
- Reproducibility: Code availability and/or repository information. Instructions on how to reproduce the systemâ€™s performance.
- Any Known limitations or constraints of the developed system.
- Any specific hardware or software requirements for running the system.

Please submit your one page system description by the 20th June/2024.
