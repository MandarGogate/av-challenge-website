# Challenge Submission
<u>All teams are required to register prior to submission and before the registration deadline.</u>

- Teams must submit a one page [system description](https://challenge.cogmhear.org/#/getting-started/systems-description) per entry by the 20th of June/2024.

# Evaluation

Evaluation of the systems will be performed by running listening tests with human participants. 

A few remarks about the submission:

- We expect submissions to contain enhanced audio samples only (just the audio files). 
- If the audio files contain a different number of samples than the original files, we will zero pad (or trim) the signals before merging them to the video.
- Teams can submit one primary and one contrastive entry per track; however, we reserve the right not to include all contrastive entries in the subjective evaluation due to time constraints.

Please submit your entry (or entries) using the Google Form link provided through the mailing list.
