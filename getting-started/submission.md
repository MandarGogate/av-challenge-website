# Evaluation

Evaluation of the systems will be performed by running listening tests with human participants. 

A few remarks about the submission:

- We expect submissions to contain enhanced audio samples only (just the audio files). 
- If the audio files contain a different number of samples than the original files, we will zero pad (or trim) the signals before merging them to the video.
- Teams can submit one primary and one contrastive entry per track; however, we reserve the right not to include all contrastive entries in the subjective evaluation due to time constraints.


Further information about the submission to the challenge TBA.
