## Call for papers: 3rd COG-MHEAR Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Challenge (AVSEC-3) 



The Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Challenge (AVSEC) sets the first benchmark in the field of audio-visual speech enhancement, providing a carefully designed dataset and scalable protocol for human listening evaluation of audio-visual speech enhancement systems. Two previous successful editions of the Challenge (SLT 2022 and ASRU 2023) show a general trend of system improvement but indicate that an intelligibility gap remains when compared to clean speech.  


We will run a third edition of the challenge, AVSEC-3, in the first half of 2024.  Papers related to the challenge to be presented at a dedicated workshop with timing aligned to Interspeech 2024 in Greece.  The AVSEC results will also be announced at the workshop.  Furthermore, the workshop will showcase ongoing technology developments in audio-visual speech enhancement and to provide a space to reflect on the scope and limitations of current speech and hearing technologies. 


We invite submissions from participants of the second and third editions of the challenge, and also welcome submissions of related research topics, including but not limited to the following:


- Audio quality & intelligibility assessment of audio-visual speech enhancement systems.
- Objective metrics to predict quality & intelligibility from audio-visual stimuli.
- Human auditory-inspired models of multi-modal speech perception and enhancement.
- Real-time and low-latency approaches to audio-visual speech enhancement and separation.
- Energy-efficient audio-visual speech enhancement and separation methods.
- Machine learning for diverse target listeners and diverse listening scenarios.
- Understanding human speech perception in competing speaker scenarios.
- Clinical applications of audio-visual speech enhancement and separation (e.g. for hearing impaired listeners).
- Accessibility and human-centric factors in the design and evaluation of multi-modal hearing assistive technologies, including public perceptions, ethics considerations, standards, societal, economic and political impacts.
