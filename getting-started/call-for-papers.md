## Call for papers: 3rd COG-MHEAR Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Challenge (AVSEC-3) 

The COG-MHEAR Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Challenge (AVSEC) sets the first benchmark in the field, providing a carefully designed dataset and scalable protocol for human listening evaluation of audio-visual speech enhancement systems. The open AVSEC framework aims to stimulate collaborative research and innovation to enable the development and evaluation of next-generation audio-visual speech enhancement and separation systems, including multimodal assistive hearing and communication technologies.
Two previous successful editions of the Challenge (organised as part of IEEE SLT 2022 and IEEE ASRU 2023) show a general trend of system improvement but indicate that an intelligibility gap remains when compared to clean speech.
We are running a third edition of the Challenge, AVSEC-3, as a satellite Workshop of INTERSPEECH 2024, to be held on 1 September, in Kos Island, Greece.


The AVSEC results will be announced at the workshop. Furthermore, the workshop will showcase ongoing technology developments in audio-visual speech enhancement, and provide networking and collaborative space for participants to reflect on the scope and limitations of current speech and hearing technologies.


Accepted Workshop papers (both short 2-page and full-length papers of 4-6 pages following the INTERSPEECH 2024 paper template) will be published in ISCA Proceedings.


Authors of selected papers (including winners and runner-ups of each Challenge Track) will be invited to submit significantly extended papers for consideration in a Special Issue of the [IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/special-issue-deadlines/ieee-jstsp-special-issue-deep-multimodal-speech-enhancement-and-separation)

## Paper Submission and Topics

We invite prospective authors to submit either 2-page short paper or full-length papers of 4-6 pages following the INTERSPEECH 2024 paper template.

We welcome submissions from participants of the second (AVSEC-2) and third editions (AVSEC-3) of the Challenge, and also invite submissions on related research topics, including but not limited to the following:

- Low-latency approaches to audio-visual speech enhancement and separation.
- Human auditory-inspired models of multi-modal speech perception and enhancement.
- Energy-efficient audio-visual speech enhancement and separation methods.
- Machine learning for diverse target listeners and diverse listening scenarios.
- Audio quality & intelligibility assessment of audio-visual speech enhancement systems.
- Objective metrics to predict quality & intelligibility from audio-visual stimuli.
- Understanding human speech perception in competing speaker scenarios.
- Clinical applications of audio-visual speech enhancement and separation, e.g. multi-modal hearing assistive technologies for hearing-impaired listeners, and speech-enabled communication aids to support  autistic people with speech disorders.
- Accessibility and human-centric factors in the design and evaluation of innovative multimodal technologies, including multi-modal corpus development, public perceptions, ethics considerations, standards, societal, economic and political impacts.
