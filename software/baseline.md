# Baseline model

Challenge entrants are supplied with a fully functioning baseline model. Figure 1 shows a simplified schematic:

You are free to use any parts of the baseline that are useful to you, and reconfigure the system as you feel fit.

The model code is available at: [GitHub](https://github.com/cogmhear/avse_challenge/tree/main/baseline/avse2)

The pretrained model is available at: [link](https://data.cstr.ed.ac.uk/cogmhear/protected/avsec2_ckpt.zip)

The credentials to download the pretrained model are the same as the ones used to download the noise dataset and the metadata (received after registration).
