# Baseline model for AVSEC-4

Challenge entrants are supplied with a fully functioning baseline model.

You are free to use any parts of the baseline that are useful to you, and reconfigure the system as you feel fit.

Scrips for binaural and single-channel versions of the baseline model are available [here](https://github.com/cogmhear/avse_challenge/tree/main/baseline/avse4)

And model weights are available [here](https://huggingface.co/cogmhear/avse4_baseline)
