# Baseline model

Challenge entrants are supplied with a fully functioning baseline model. Figure 1 shows a simplified schematic:

You are free to use any parts of the baseline that are useful to you, and reconfigure the system as you feel fit.

The model code is available at: [GitHub](https://github.com/cogmhear/avse_challenge)

The pretrained models will be made available here shortly.
